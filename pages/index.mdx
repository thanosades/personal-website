<p>Hi! I'm a Software Engineer. I currently work as a Junior Fullstack Engineer at <a href="https://squaredev.io/">Squaredev</a>.</p> 
<p>I'm passionate about backend engineering, with an emphasis on API design, database optimizations and the optimization of scalable data-driven applications.</p>
<p>When I'm not building software I pretend that I'm good at video games, Yu-Gi-Oh! and chess.</p>
